# Slayer Task Streak Reminder
This plugin is a simple reminder that notifies you in chat to remind you to konar boost when you have a streak.

It will notify you if both your next task will be a point streak and you are in proximinity of any slayer master except for Vannaka, Krystilia, Spria, and Mazchna.
